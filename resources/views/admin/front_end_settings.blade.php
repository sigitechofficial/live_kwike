                                It started with an idea, a forecast
                                It is the time there are grab, food panda, etc. but mostly in Manila. It was the time the creep of pandemic starts. That is when its founder, with knowledge of IT and marketing, invests to have an app that can be in the market especially in Batangas. He forecast that by time goes many will get into delivery and in social media. It was that small leap. Eventually his forecast got right. And now Xoomi offers the best deal for those enterprises.
